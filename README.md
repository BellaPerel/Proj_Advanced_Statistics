In this project, we delved into the "2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro" dataset sourced from Kaggle, showcasing a step-by-step journey through data analysis using a diverse array of methods and tools. The project unfolded across five distinct segments, with each stage building upon the previous one.

**Part 1:** Our initial phase involved dataset pre-processing, offering a glimpse into descriptive statistics and the distribution of numeric variables. Categorical variables came under scrutiny through histograms and boxplots, and we meticulously reported missing data. Additionally, we framed three research questions that would guide our subsequent investigations.

**Part 2:** In the second phase, we honed in on one of the research questions from Part 1, employing rigorous hypothesis tests like the T-test, F-test, and Wald test. We also crafted confidence intervals for variables tied to the research question, elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of our analyses.

**Part 3:** The third leg of our journey led us into the realm of linear and logistic regression models. Here, we computed the beta vector, delved into ANOVA tables, and evaluated metrics such as R-squared and R-adj. Statistical tests were harnessed to scrutinize the beta vector and its associated confidence intervals. We ensured that our linear models adhered to key assumptions through the use of residual graphs, and we engaged in model comparison, employing interaction models and Regression Stepwise Backward/Forward techniques to unearth the optimal model.

**Part 4:** In the fourth phase, we harnessed the power of the bootstrap method, applying it to our linear regression model. This allowed us to construct confidence intervals for beta estimators and generate new observations. We explored various types of confidence intervals, including quantile-based, pivotal, and those grounded in the normal approximation. Our toolkit also encompassed permutation tests and Wald tests.

**Part 5:** The final leg of our journey ventured into Bayesian methods for calculating the log ratio, accompanied by a thorough exploration of different priors and posterior computations. We also tackled the intricate challenge of handling missing data, comparing methodologies such as mutation regression imputation, multiple imputation, and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW).

In summation, this project served as a comprehensive tutorial in data analysis. We covered the spectrum from data preprocessing and formulating research questions to hypothesis testing, regression modeling, bootstrap resampling, Bayesian analysis, and managing missing data. Throughout the journey, we harnessed a rich arsenal of statistical tools and techniques, including ANOVA tables, residual analysis, confidence intervals, and model selection methodologies. This comprehensive exploration equips us with a robust toolkit for conducting data-driven investigations.
